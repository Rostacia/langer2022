							<h4>Biocement from the ocean: Hybrid microbial-electrochemical mineralization of CO<sub>2</sub></h4>
							<!-- <h5>Abstract</h5> -->
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/DevanSolanki.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> are leading to rising global temperatures and extreme weather events. However, the most prominent method of removing CO<sub>2</sub> via direct air capture remains cost-prohibitive. Oceans sequester carbon through several naturally occurring carbon dioxide removal (CDR) processes, one of which includes microorganisms that utilize dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in their metabolic processes. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is in dynamic equilibrium with DIC at the ocean's surface. Thus, ocean-based CDR can function to capture carbon from the air indirectly. This work discusses a hybrid method that combines primary CO<sub>2</sub> capture via the growth of autotrophic microorganisms (i.e., photosynthetic cyanobacteria) and microbially induced carbonate precipitation. Carbon fixation and carbonate precipitation can be co-optimized using bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED) devices , which generate seawater with an adjustable pH. We examine the scale-up potential for naturally produced bio-carbonate composite material and compare its production with published ocean CDR strategies for reducing anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

							<h4>What to Expect When Expecting in Lab: Green Chemistry Resources for Pregnant Researchers in the Chemical Laboratory</h4>
							<!-- <h5>Abstract</h5> -->
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/MaryKateLane.JPG" alt="" /></span>Despite receiving approximately half of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) baccalaureate degrees, women are increasingly underrepresented as career stages advance, often referred to as the “leaky pipeline.” There is particularly high attrition in the midcareer—a time when many women have children—suggesting a component of the leaky pipeline could be attributed to challenges surrounding pregnancy and parenthood. This notion is supported by a 2019 study by Cech and Blair-Loy that showed 43% of female scientists left full-time STEM employment after the birth of their first child, as opposed to 23% of male first-time parent scientists and 24% of childless women scientists. In an effort to retain and support women and parents in chemical careers, we present our recent review of unique risks and resources for pregnant researchers in the chemical laboratory, where a chemical laboratory is defined as an industry or academic laboratory engaging in primary research in fields like chemistry, engineering, or medicine, but excluding biological work with substances such as pathogens or live organisms. We examine lab relevant doses for commonly encountered hazards for pregnant lab workers, including chemical hazards (organic solvents, heavy metals, engineered nanomaterials, and endocrine disruptors), radiation hazards (ionizing radiation producing equipment and materials and non-ionizing radiation producing equipment), and other hazards related to the lab environment (excessive noise, excessive heat, psychosocial stress, strenuous physical work, and/or abnormal working hours). Inspired by the principles of Green Chemistry and Green Engineering, reducing hazard is the most promising route to eliminating or at least minimizing risk—as it is an intrinsic and constant property of chemicals and processes—whereas exposure controls can and often fail. Therefore, implementing green chemistry could directly benefit pregnant researchers in a laboratory setting. This oral presentation will share the main findings of this review, highlight many green chemistry tools, and indicate where green chemistry can aid in furthering creating safe laboratory spaces for pregnant researchers.</p>
							<h5>Biography</h5>

							<h4>Sooting tendencies of phenolic hydrocarbons from lignin conversion and upgrading</h4>
							<!-- <h5>Abstract</h5> -->
							<p id="aurora"><span class="image left"><img src="images/Aurora.JPG" alt="" /></span>Phenolic hydrocarbons are produced in large quantities when lignocellulosic biomass is processed into fuels. Traditionally these phenols have been viewed as undesirable due to properties such as their acidity, so they are removed during subsequent fuel processing. However, they also have beneficial fuel properties such as high energy density and low sooting tendencies. Soot emissions are the second largest source of global warming and contribute to ambient fine particulates that cause millions of deaths annually. In this work quantitative sooting tendencies were measured for a wide range of phenolics, including benzenediols and benzenetriols, alkylphenols (e.g., n-propylphenol), methoxyphenols (e.g., guaiacol and syringol), allylphenols (e.g., eugenol), and phenolic aldehydes (e.g., vanillin). The sooting tendencies were determined by doping the test compounds into the fuel of a methane/air nonpremixed flame at low concentrations (typically 1000 ppm) and measuring the resulting soot concentration. The absolute soot concentrations were converted into yield sooting indices (YSIs) by rescaling them relative to n-heptane and toluene reference fuels. Many phenolics are solids at room temperature, so they were dissolved in ethanol and then the liquid solutions were injected into the flame. The results confirm that the oxygen in phenols reduces soot formation relative to the analogous regular hydrocarbons. For example, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene has a YSI of 9.7 versus 100.3 for benzene. The sooting tendencies depend strongly on molecular structure parameters such as the position of the hydroxyl group relative to other sidechains, the length of the other side-chains, branching in the other side-chains, etc. These results provide a basis for identifying specific phenols that can be produced as renewable fuels from biomass while combining low soot emissions with acceptable values of other fuel properties.</p>

							<h4>High-temperature Superconductivity in an induced-pressure linked-graphene oxide confinement system</h4>
							<!-- <h5>Abstract</h5> -->
							<p id="rachel"><span class="image right"><img src="images/RachelYang.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Superconductor technology has various applications in electricity generation, energy storage, power transmission, and even in medicine. Raising the superconductivity transition temperature has been the foremost pursuit for superconductivity research. Recent works have shown that high-temperature superconductivity (around 200 K)  can be achieved by applying high pressures (around 150 GPa). However, this kind of finding is hard to exploit in the real world because it requires materials to be compressed to extreme pressures constantly. We have been exploring using confinement systems to induce pressure inside the material so that properties generated at high pressure can be retained after the pressure is relieved. By inserting nanoparticles into our confinement system, which is constructed by linking graphene oxide (GO) layers with dithiol linkers, pressure can be  induced by the strain generated within the system. We are able to determine and control the spacing between the GO layers by using different concentrations and types of linkers, and the induced pressure can be quantified using Raman spectroscopy. We are currently investigating the effect of different species and sizes of the doped nanoparticles on the resultant superconductivity with the help of XPS, XAFS, XRD, and SQUID. </p>

							<h3>David Kim</h3>
							<h4>Pulsed electrolysis for long-term water treatment</h4>
							<!-- <h5>Abstract</h5> -->
							<p id="david"><span class="image left"><img src="images/DavidKim.png" alt="" /></span>Electrocatalytic treatment of wastewater has emerged onto the limelight of scientific interest, yet their long-term viability remains largely in the dark. In this talk, I will showcase the efficacy of pulsed electrolysis to bolster resilience to impurities and overall longevity by examining real wastewater constituents, assessing catalyst design, and optimizing operational parameters. Using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> electrosynthesis as the target reaction, our systematic pulsing framework unveils superior performance for a boron-doped carbon catalyst with high selectivity (80%) and near complete recovery in overpotentials even in the presence of highly detrimental metal impurities.</p>
							<h5>Biography</h5>
							<p>David is a fifth-year PhD student in the Kim group. His research interests involve enhancing the long-term performance of electrocatalysts for wastewater treatment purposes. Outside of the lab, he loves watching football and spending time with his sassy dog, Choco.</p>
